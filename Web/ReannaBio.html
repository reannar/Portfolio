    <strong>About ME:</strong>

  <p>
    My name is Reanna Ramirez and have lived in San Jose for all of my life. I will be an incoming Junior in the fall. My school is Cristo Rey San Jose Jesuit High School which is located in downtown SJ. I love spending time with my family. I also am very passionate about social justice in my community, I have attended many immersion trips to help better understand the social injustices of my community. The university I hope to attend is Santa Clara University which is also a private Jesuit school.
