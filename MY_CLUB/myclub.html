<center> We have <strong>committed</strong> to enhance the competive playing field so that every person has the same resources and so that every person can be able to show growth. <center>

  <p>
  <center>About Us <center>
  </p>

<center>It started as an idea that soon transformed into a plan. With only a budget of $100 dollars we were able to create a selfsustaining club. This club will expand and be able to grow in size. We have reached out to our bay area community in support to help everyone have the same resources. This club was made because our founders did not have a place to get help so they thought to create a safe place. <center>
